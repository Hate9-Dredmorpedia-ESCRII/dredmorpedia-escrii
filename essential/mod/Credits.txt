Art credits to: 

Loren -- most all of the badassest icons in the pack, esp. Kung Fu, Wild Magic, and Archmage. Also Gangnam Style's main icon.
Twisted_Polygon -- a few of the sweetest Warlockery icons.
digglemaggot -- a nifty sprite for Mana Crush.
Blind Piper -- the Carrotty Form's ability to eat and drink with it's eyes.


Thank you very much to all of you without whom this mod wouldn't be nearly as badass.  You rock!
