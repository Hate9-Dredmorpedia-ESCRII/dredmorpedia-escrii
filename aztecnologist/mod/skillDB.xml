<!-- Concept: Rogue skill with ranged attacks and spell mines on timers (instead of mana) that scale with your trap skill.
    I want the dynamic to be that you use this tree half the time, and supplement it with bolts, thrown, spells, or traps.
	Gives trap skill and trap sight across the levels. Maybe 1 level of tinkering somewhere in the tree? -->
	

<!-- Skills that generate trap sight / trap affinity, and how much:
Perception 3 / 2     but likely +2 / +0 more when Second Sight is active
Burglary 3 / 3
Archaeology 1 / 3
Smithing 0 / 2
Tinkering 2 / 10
Egyptian Magic 0 / 0 but likely  +1 / +1 more most of the time due to Glyph of Imhotep
Tourist 0 / 1 but likely an +1 / +2 more most of the time due to See The Sights
Aztecnologist itself 4 / 4

So it's probably safe to assume everyone who takes this will have access to around 9 / 17 by late game
but probably half that or less for most of the dungeon

A character intentionally built to maximize this skill would start with 3 / 3,
and if they leveled up just the skills that gave the best stats in 15 level-ups they'd be at 11/17
(and the max someone could ever have is 13 / 25 bumped up to 16 / 27 or less with all active procs,
but the max is very unlikely because you'll want some other healing or damage-dealing ability,
and getting to this stage in traps takes 30 levels of rogue skills)
so I should scale damage with those in mind.  

By contrast, a character with all wizard skills starts the game with 7 magic power,
and with 15 level ups in wizard has about 22 magic power, 
and if they max out all their skills they'll have around 40 magic power (though they may not ever reach that point).

So if I'm scaling to Trap Sight, I can probably do about double the damageF of a similar level wizard spell.
Maybe more than that, as spells are spammable, especially in the late game. If one fireball is good, two back-to-back will be better.
