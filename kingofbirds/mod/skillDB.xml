<!-- Concept: Fighter skill weird bird-brained bonuses. Birding and Falconry Mod. 
Stat boosts in line with Regal Belt, because falconry is the sport of kings.
Synergy with Big Game Hunter is a must.
This should be a supercharger or toolbox, not an engine itself. So bonuses are broad but unreliable, with some utility skills.
Fighters have lots of engines, not much else. -->
